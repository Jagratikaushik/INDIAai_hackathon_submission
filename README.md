This is the link for saved BERT model for both category and sub-category classification.

Procedure to run:
To run the code u need to first upload the train.csv (train dataset) and test.csv (test dataset) on the google drive and then run the collab notebooks.Then run the cells one by one in each collab notebook to see the results. The trained naive-bayes model is saved in model_nb.pkl file and the trained bert model is saved in the google-drive link which is uploaded here.

First the 'crimeaditionalinfo' of both the train and test dataset is preprocessed and then tokenised. Then it is used to train the models to predict the category and sub-category of the crime.
